## Overview

MqttDeviceTwin is a concrete class extending Mqtt. This class implements all the abstract methods from MQTT and overrides
the receive, onReconnect, and onReconnectComplete events.

```java
public final class MqttDeviceTwin extends Mqtt
{
    public MqttDeviceTwin() throws TransportException;

    public Message receive() throws TransportException;
    public void send(DeviceTwinMessage message) throws TransportException;

    public void start() throws TransportException;
    public void stop() throws TransportException;

}
```
